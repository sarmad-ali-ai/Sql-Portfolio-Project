🏥 SQL Portfolio Project – Hospital Intelligence Dashboard

📌 Overview
This project simulates the role of a junior healthcare data analyst, working with hospital datasets to generate actionable insights.  
The analysis is designed to help hospital management make data-driven decisions by examining patient encounters, procedures, costs, and readmissions.  

📊 Database Coverage
- Encounters (visits, admission/discharge times, encounter class)  
- Patients (demographics, age groups)  
- Procedures(types, costs, frequency)  
- Payer Coverage (insurance details, claim costs)  
- Diagnoses (conditions, treatments)  
- Medications
  
 🔍 Key Insights & Analysis

  - Total encounters per year  
  - Yearly % breakdown by encounter class (inpatient, emergency, outpatient)  
  - Duration-based classification (Short vs. Long stay)  

- Financial & Coverage Insights
  - Zero payer coverage cases  
  - Top 10 most frequent procedures + average cost
